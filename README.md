Select a folder, and view all projects in the location, with 2 options for each project: <br>1) Open in your default browser(prefers your index.html if there is one)<br>2) Open the project folder in VScode
<br>
A folder is considered a project folder if it copntains "prj" in its name.<br>
Folders that contain multiple projects inside are treated as tags and displayed next to the projects name
Additionally, option to create new "repos" inside of your desired path exists :D
